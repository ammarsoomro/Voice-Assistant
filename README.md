Creating a voice-controlled personal assistant in Python involves using libraries for speech recognition and text-to-speech functionality. Below, I will guide you through the process of building a simple voice assistant using the SpeechRecognition library for recognizing speech and pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion.

Key Components
Speech Recognition: This allows the assistant to understand spoken commands.
Text-to-Speech: This enables the assistant to respond verbally.
Command Handling: The assistant will execute specific commands based on recognized speech.
